# PerfectHadoop: MapReduce History Server

This project provides a Swift wrapper of MapReduce History Server REST API:

- `MapReduceHistory()`: access to all applications on map / reduce history server.

## Connect to Hadoop Map Reduce History Server

To connect to your Hadoop Map / Reduce History server by Perfect, initialize a `MapReduceHistory()` object with sufficient parameters:

``` swift
// this connection could possibly do some basic operations
let history = MapReduceHistory(host: "mapReduceHistory.somedomain.com", port: 19888)
```
or connect to Hadoop Map / Reduce History server with a valid user name:

``` swift
// add user name if need
let history = MapReduceHistory(host: "mapReduceHistory.somedomain.com", port: 19888, user: "your user name")
```

### Authentication
If using Kerberos to authenticate, please try codes below:

``` swift
// set auth to kerberos
let history = MapReduceHistory(host: "mapReduceHistory.somedomain.com", port: 19888, user: "username", auth: .krb5)
```

### Parameters of MapReduceHistory Object
Item|Data Type|Description
----|---------|-----------
service|String|the service protocol of web request - http / https
host|String|the hostname or ip address of the Hadoop Map Reduce history server host
port|Int|the port of host, default is 19888
auth|Authorization| .off or .krb5. Default value is .off
proxyUser|String|proxy user, if applicable
apibase|String|use this parameter *ONLY* the target server has a different api routine other than `/ws/v1/history`
timeout|Int|timeout in seconds, zero means never timeout during transfer

## Get General Information
Call `checkInfo()` to get the general information of a Hadoop MapReduce History Server in form of a `MapReduceHistory.Info` structure:

``` swift
guard let inf = try history.checkInfo() else {
	// something goes wrong here
}
print(inf.startedOn)
print(inf.hadoopVersion)
print(inf.hadoopBuildVersion)
print(inf.hadoopVersionBuiltOn)
```

### Members of `MapReduceHistory.Info `

Item|Data Type|Description
----|---------|-----------
startedOn|Int|The time the history server was started (in ms since epoch)
hadoopVersion|String|Version of hadoop common
hadoopBuildVersion|String|Hadoop common build string with build version, user, and checksum
hadoopVersionBuiltOn|String|Timestamp when hadoop common was built

## Historical MapReduce Jobs

Call `checkJobs()` to return an array of `Job` structure.
The jobs resource provides a list of the MapReduce jobs that have finished. It does not currently return a full list of parameters. The simplest form is `checkJobs()`, which will return all jobs available:


``` swift
let jobs = try history.checkJobs()
// or you can narrow the query result by set some parameters:
// let jobs = try his.checkJobs(state: .SUCCEEDED, queue: "default", limit: 10)
jobs.forEach { j in
  print(j.id)
  print(j.name)
  print(j.queue)
  print(j.state)
}
```

## Tasks of a Job

Use `checkJobTasks()` to collect task information from a specific job:

``` swift
// get all tasks information from a specific job
let tasks = try his.checkJobTasks(jobId: "job_1484231633049_0005")

  print(t.id)
  print(t.type)
  print(t.successfulAttempt)
  print(t.finishTime)
}//next t
```
### Parameters of checkJobTasks()

Calling `checkJobTasks()` requires a jobId all the time, however, you can also specify an extra parameter to indicate what type of tasks shall be listed in the query results:

- jobId: a string represents the id of the job
- taskType: optional, could be `.MAP` or `.REDUCE`

### JobTask Object

The `checkJobTasks()` will return an array of `JobTask` data structure, as described below:

Item|Data Type|Description
----|---------|-----------
id|string|The task id
state|String|The state of the task - valid values are: NEW, SCHEDULED, RUNNING, SUCCEEDED, FAILED, KILL_WAIT, KILLED
type|String|The task type - MAP or REDUCE
successfulAttempt|String|The id of the last successful attempt
progress|Double|The progress of the task as a percent
startTime|Int|The time in which the task started (in ms since epoch) or -1 if it was never started
finishTime|Int|The time in which the task finished (in ms since epoch)
elapsedTime|Int|The elapsed time since the application started (in ms)

## Query a Specific JobTask

If both `jobId` and `jobTaskId` are available, you can use `checkJobTask()` to perform a query on a specific job task:

``` swift
guard let task = try his.checkJobTask(jobId: "job_1484231633049_0005", taskId: "task_1326381300833_2_2_m_0") else {
	// something wrong
}
print(task.progress)
```
The return value of `checkJobTask` will be a [JobTask](# JobTask Object) object, as described above.

## Task Counters of Job

Method `checkJobTaskCounters()` can return counters of a specific task, as the example below:

``` swift
guard let js = try his.checkJobTaskCounters(jobId: "job_1484231633049_0005", taskId: "task_1326381300833_2_2_m_0") else {
	// something wrong
}
// print the id of the job task counters
print(js.id)
// check out each counter group
js.taskCounterGroup.forEach{ group in
  print(group.counterGroupName)
  // print counters in each group.
  group.counters.forEach { counter in
    print(counter.name)
    print(counter.value)
  }
}
```
### JobTaskCounter Object

Item|Data Type|Description
----|---------|-----------
id|String|The job id
taskCounterGroup|[CounterGroup]|An array of counter group objects, See [CounterGroup](# CounterGroup Object)

## Task Attempts

Function `checkJobTaskAttempts()` can return attempts from a specific job task.

``` swift
let jobTaskAttempts = try his.checkJobTaskAttempts(jobId: "job_1484231633049_0005", taskId: "task_1326381300833_2_2_m_0")
for attempt in jobTaskAttempts {
  print(attempt.id)
  print(attempt.diagnostics)
  print(attempt.assignedContainerId)
  print(attempt.rack)
  print(attempt.state)
  print(attempt.progress)
}//next
```

Once done, the `checkJobTaskAttempts` will return an array of `TaskAttempt` object, as described below:

### TaskAttempt Object

Elements of the TaskAttempt object:

Item|Data Type|Description
----|---------|-----------
id|String|The task id
rack|String|The rack
state|TaskAttempt.State|The state of the task attempt - valid values are: NEW, UNASSIGNED, ASSIGNED, RUNNING, COMMIT_PENDING, SUCCESS_CONTAINER_CLEANUP, SUCCEEDED, FAIL_CONTAINER_CLEANUP, FAIL_TASK_CLEANUP, FAILED, KILL_CONTAINER_CLEANUP, KILL_TASK_CLEANUP, KILLED

shuffleFinishTime|Int|The time at which shuffle finished (in ms since epoch)
mergeFinishTime|Int|The time at which merge finished (in ms since epoch)
elapsedShuffleTime|Int|The time it took for the shuffle phase to complete (time in ms between reduce task start and shuffle finish)
elapsedMergeTime|Int|The time it took for the merge phase to complete (time in ms between the shuffle finish and merge finish)
elapsedReduceTime|Int|The time it took for the reduce phase to complete (time in ms between merge finish to end of reduce task)


### Query a Specific TaskAttempt
If a taskAttempt id is available, you can also check the specific one by `checkJobTaskAttempt()`, as demo below:

``` swift
guard let jobTaskAttempts = try his.checkJobTaskAttempt(jobId: "job_1484231633049_0005", taskId: "task_1326381300833_2_2_m_0", "attempt_1326381300833_2_2_m_0_0") else {
	// something wrong
	print("there is no such a task attempt")
	return
}//end guard
print(attempt.id)
print(attempt.diagnostics)
print(attempt.assignedContainerId)
print(attempt.rack)
print(attempt.state)
print(attempt.progress)
```
The `checkJobTaskAttempt()` will return such an [TaskAttempt object](# TaskAttempt Object) as described above.

## Attempt Counters of Task

Method `checkJobTaskAttemptCounters()` can return counters of a specific task attempt, as the example below:

``` swift
guard let counters = try his.checkJobTaskAttemptCounters(jobId: "job_1484231633049_0005", taskId: "task_1326381300833_2_2_m_0", "attempt_1326381300833_2_2_m_0_0") else {
	// something wrong
	print("Task Attempt Counters Acquiring failed")
	return
}
// print the counters' id
print(counters.id)
// enumerate all groups
for group in counters.taskAttemptCounterGroup {
  // print group name
  print(group.counterGroupName)
  // enumerate all counters in this group
  for counter in group.counters {
    print(counter.name)
    print(counter.value)
  }//next counter
}//next group
}

```
