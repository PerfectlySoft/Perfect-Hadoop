# PerfectHadoop: MapReduce Application

This project provides a Swift wrapper of MapReduce Application Master REST API:

- `MapReduceApplication()`: access a specific map / reduce application running on current server.

## RELEASE NOTE
⚠️This is an experimental module and is subject to change in future. ⚠️

## Connect to Hadoop Map Reduce Application

To connect to a current active Hadoop Map / Reduce Application by Perfect, initialize a `MapReduceApplication()` object with an *APPLICATION ID*, and other essential parameters:

``` swift
// this connection could possibly do some basic operations
let app = MapReduceApplication(applicationId: "application_12345678_xxxxxx", host: "mapReducer.somedomain.com")
```
you can also 

``` swift
// add user name if need
let app = MapReduceApplication(applicationId: "application_12345678_xxxxxx", host: "mapReducer.somedomain.com", user: "your user name")
```


### Authentication
If using Kerberos to authenticate, please try codes below:

``` swift
// set auth to kerberos
let app = MapReduceApplication(applicationId: "application_12345678_xxxxxx", host: "mapReducer.somedomain.com", user: "your user name", auth: .krb5)
```


### Parameters of MapReduceApplication Object
Item|Data Type|Description
----|---------|-----------
applicationId|String|the id string of the application to control. *Required* 
service|String|the service protocol of web request - http / https
host|String|the hostname or ip address of the Hadoop Map Reduce Application Master host
port|Int|the port of map reduce application master host, default is 8088
auth| Authorization| .off or .krb5. Default value is .off
proxyUser|String|proxy user, if applicable
apibase|String|use this parameter *ONLY* the target server has a different api routine other than `/ws/v1/mapreduce`
timeout`:Int, timeout in seconds, zero means never timeout during transfer


## Get General Information
Call `checkInfo()` to get the general information of a Hadoop MapReduce Application Master in form of a `MapReduceApplication.Info` structure:

``` swift
guard let inf = try app.checkInfo() else {
	// something goes wrong here
}
print(inf.startedOn)
print(inf.hadoopVersion)
print(inf.hadoopBuildVersion)
print(inf.hadoopVersionBuiltOn)
```

### Members of `MapReduceApplication.Info `

Item|Data Type|Description
----|---------|-----------
appId|Int|The application id
startedOn|Int|The time the application started (in ms since epoch)
name|string|The name of the application
user|string|The user name of the user who started the application
elapsedTime|long|The time since the application was started (in ms)

## MapReduce Jobs

Call `checkJobs()` to return an array of `Job` structure.
The jobs resource provides a list of the MapReduce jobs that have finished. It does not currently return a full list of parameters. The simplest form is `checkJobs()`, which will return all jobs available:


``` swift
let jobs = try app.checkJobs()
jobs.forEach { j in
  print(j.id)
  print(j.name)
  print(j.queue)
  print(j.state)
}
```
If succeeded, `checkJobs()` would probably return a job object as described below:

### Parameters of checkJobTasks()

Calling `checkJobTasks()` requires a jobId all the time, however, you can also specify an extra parameter to indicate what type of tasks shall be listed in the query results:

- jobId: a string represents the id of the job
- taskType: optional, could be `.MAP` or `.REDUCE`

### JobTask Object

The `checkJobTasks()` will return an array of `JobTask` data structure, as described below:

Item|Data Type|Description

finishTime|Int|The time in which the task finished (in ms since epoch)
elapsedTime|Int|The elapsed time since the application started (in ms)

## Query a Specific JobTask

If both `jobId` and `jobTaskId` are available, you can use `checkJobTask()` to perform a query on a specific job task:

``` swift
guard let task = try app.checkJobTask(jobId: "job_1484231633049_0005", taskId: "task_1326381300833_2_2_m_0") else {
	// something wrong
}
print(task.progress)
```
The return value of `checkJobTask` will be a [JobTask](# JobTask Object) object, as described above.

## Task Counters of Job

Method `checkJobTaskCounters()` can return counters of a specific task, as the example below:

``` swift
guard let js = try app.checkJobTaskCounters(jobId: "job_1484231633049_0005", taskId: "task_1326381300833_2_2_m_0") else {
	// something wrong
}
// print the id of the job task counters
print(js.id)
// check out each counter group
js.taskCounterGroup.forEach{ group in
  print(group.counterGroupName)
  // print counters in each group.
  group.counters.forEach { counter in
    print(counter.name)
    print(counter.value)
  }
}
```
### JobTaskCounter Object

for attempt in jobTaskAttempts {
  print(attempt.id)
  print(attempt.diagnostics)
  print(attempt.assignedContainerId)
  print(attempt.rack)
  print(attempt.state)
  print(attempt.progress)

elapsedReduceTime|Int|The time it took for the reduce phase to complete (time in ms between merge finish to end of reduce task)


### Query a Specific TaskAttempt
If a taskAttempt id is available, you can also check the specific one by `checkJobTaskAttempt()`, as demo below:

``` swift
guard let jobTaskAttempts = try app.checkJobTaskAttempt(jobId: "job_1484231633049_0005", taskId: "task_1326381300833_2_2_m_0", "attempt_1326381300833_2_2_m_0_0") else {
	// something wrong
	print("there is no such a task attempt")
	return
}//end guard
print(attempt.id)
print(attempt.diagnostics)
print(attempt.assignedContainerId)
print(attempt.rack)
print(attempt.state)
print(attempt.progress)
```
The `checkJobTaskAttempt()` will return such an [TaskAttempt object](# TaskAttempt Object) as described above.

## Attempt State Control

Currently Hadoop MapReduce Application Master has an experimental attempt state control.

### Check Attempt
To check a running attempt state, use `checkJobTaskAttemptState()`:
``` swift
guard let state = try checkJobTaskAttemptState(jobId: "job_1484231633049_0005", taskId: "task_1326381300833_2_2_m_0", "attempt_1326381300833_2_2_m_0_0") else {
	// something wrong
	print("there is no such a task attempt")
	return
}//end guard
print(state)
```
### Kill Attempt
To terminate an attempt, call `killTaskAttempt()`:

``` swift
try killTaskAttempt(jobId: "job_1484231633049_0005", taskId: "task_1326381300833_2_2_m_0", "attempt_1326381300833_2_2_m_0_0")
```

## Attempt Counters of Task

Method `checkJobTaskAttemptCounters()` can return counters of a specific task attempt, as the example below:

``` swift
guard let counters = try app.checkJobTaskAttemptCounters(jobId: "job_1484231633049_0005", taskId: "task_1326381300833_2_2_m_0", "attempt_1326381300833_2_2_m_0_0") else {
	// something wrong
	print("Task Attempt Counters Acquiring failed")
	return 
}
// print the counters' id
print(counters.id)
// enumerate all groups
for group in counters.taskAttemptCounterGroup {
  // print group name
  print(group.counterGroupName)
  // enumerate all counters in this group
  for counter in group.counters {
    print(counter.name)
    print(counter.value)
  }//next counter
}//next group
}
