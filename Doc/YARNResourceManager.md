# PerfectHadoop: YARN Resource Manager

This project provides a Swift wrapper of YARN Resource Manager REST API:

- `YARNResourceManager()`: access to cluster information of YARN, including cluster and its metrics, scheduler, application submit, etc.

 
## Connect to YARN Resource Manager

To connect to your Hadoop YARN Resource Manager by Perfect, initialize a `YARNResourceManager()` object with sufficient parameters:

``` swift
// this connection could possibly do some basic operations
let yarn = YARNResourceManager(host: "yarn.somehadoopdomain.com", port: 8088)
```
or connect to Hadoop YARN Node Manager with a valid user name:

``` swift
// add user name if need
let yarn = YARNResourceManager(host: "yarn.somehadoopdomain.com", port: 8088, user: "your user name")
```

### Authentication
If using Kerberos to authenticate, please try codes below:

``` swift
// set auth to kerberos
let yarn = YARNResourceManager(host: "yarn.somehadoopdomain.com", port: 8088, user: "username", auth: .krb5)
```

### Parameters of YARNResourceManager Object
Item|Data Type|Description
----|---------|-----------
service|String|the service protocol of web request - http / https
host|String|the hostname or ip address of the Hadoop YARN Resource Manager
port|Int|the port of yarn host, default is 8088

## Get General Information
Call `checkClusterInfo()` to get the general information of a YARN Resource Manager in form of a `ClusterInfo` structure:

``` swift
guard let i = try yarn.checkClusterInfo() else {
	print("unable to check cluster info")
	return
}//end guard
print(i.startedOn)
print(i.state)
print(i.hadoopVersion)
